# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA ESIS-UDBL)

Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors is a Microsoft program that helps students increase their knowledge and skills to share that with other students and their communities on their university campus or volunteering with an elementary school STEM class. We are based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the city of Lubumbashi, at the Universit√© DON BOSCO (UDBL).

üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
